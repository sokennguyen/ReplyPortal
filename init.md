# Requirements:
- see the message
- mark message to read

# How to?
- using a headless chrome (webkit for apple)-> get the prompts and uis from the webkit -> log in and load data from webkit.

- NO Headless services, running 24/7 receiving messages (cannot scale well)
- NO API, expensive? (Texts doesn't do that, they use headless most likely, because they support signal)
